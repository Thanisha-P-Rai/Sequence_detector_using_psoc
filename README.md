# Sequence_detector_using_psoc
This project implements a digital sequence detector using a PSoC microcontroller. It detects a predefined input bit sequence and generates an output when the correct sequence is recognized. The design uses PSoC internal resources such as GPIOs and configurable logic, making it efficient and suitable for embedded and digital system applications.
